All model training, tuning, and validation were performed in this transformed space. The stacked model achieved excellent performance here, with an R² of ~0.94 and very low error metrics, making it the best choice among all tested models.\n","\n","### Why Metrics Change After Inverse Transformation\n","\n","Once the final model was selected, I inverse‑transformed the predictions back to the original price scale to evaluate real‑world performance. This step is essential because it shows how far predictions deviate in actual currency values.\n","\n","However, the original price distribution is extremely wide:\n","\n","- **Min price:** 0  \n","- **Max price:** 269,676,000  \n","- **Median price:** 2,000,000  \n","- **IQR:** 2,550,000  \n","\n","With such a large range, even small errors in the transformed space become much larger after inverse transformation. This naturally increases RMSE and MAE and lowers R² in the original scale.\n","\n","### Interpreting the Real‑Scale Metrics\n","\n","After inverse transformation, the model produced:\n","\n","- **RMSE ≈ 5.96M**  \n","- **MAE ≈ 956k**  \n","- **Median AE ≈ 160k**  \n","- **MAPE ≈ 40%**  \n","- **R² ≈ 0.56**\n","\n","These values may look large at first, but they are reasonable relative to the price distribution:\n","\n","- A **Median AE of ~160k** is only about **8% of the median property price (2M)**.  \n","- The **MAE (~956k)** is well within the natural spread of the data (IQR ≈ 2.55M).  \n","- The **drop in R²** is expected because variance in the original scale is extremely high.  \n","- **MAPE is inflated** due to the presence of very low or zero prices.\n","\n","### Key Takeaway\n","\n","The model performs extremely well in the transformed space and generalizes consistently to the test set. The larger errors in the original scale are a direct consequence of the wide price range, not a sign of bias, variance issues, or model instability. The stacked model remains a strong and reliable choice for this prediction task.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"-O8auvWPhrAa"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["---\n","### Overall Model Assessment\n","\n","Based on the full evaluation process, the final stacked model demonstrates strong and reliable performance. It achieves excellent results in the Yeo–Johnson transformed space (R² ≈ 0.94 on both validation and test sets), indicating that the model learns the underlying patterns effectively and generalizes well.\n","\n","When predictions are inverse‑transformed back to the original price scale, the error values naturally increase due to the extremely wide price range in the dataset (0 to 270M). Despite this, the median absolute error remains reasonable relative to the median property price, and the model maintains stable behavior without signs of bias or variance issues.\n","\n","Overall, the model is performing well and provides consistent, trustworthy predictions for this task.\n","\n","\n","---"],"metadata":{"id":"mvV7Iw9ih5u3"}}]}
